    "An alcoholic beverage distiller wants to open a new distillery in the Finger Lakes region of New York. The Finger Lakes region of Western New York is a very popular destination for tourism - especially for visiting vineyards, breweries and natural geographic features, such as gorges and waterfalls. The Finger Lakes region is very large and mostly rural. The distiller wants to find a location that will be close to similar businesses like wineries, and breweries, but also be located in an area that already gets a good amount of tourism activity.\n",
